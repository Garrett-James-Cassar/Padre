# Open Telemetry

## Context
OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that facilitates the collection of traces, metrics, and logs.

### More information
OpenTelemetry consists of the following major components:

- A specification for all components
- A standard protocol that defines the shape of telemetry data
- Semantic conventions that define a standard naming scheme for common telemetry data types
- APIs that define how to generate telemetry data
- Language SDKs that implement the specification, APIs, and export of telemetry data
- A library ecosystem that implements instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks
- Automatic instrumentation components that generate telemetry data without requiring code changes
- The OpenTelemetry Collector, a proxy that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data

## Problem
See the [Three Pillars of observability](../../observability/three-pillars-of-observability.md)

## Solution
Use the Open telemetry standard to solve the three pillars

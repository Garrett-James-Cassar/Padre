# Logging Standards

## Context
A set of microservices that log events in order to inform on development decisions and production incidents.

## Problem
Logging is inconsistent in terms of the events that are logged, the information logged per event and the context 
in which the event took place. 

## Solution
Agree on a set of standards for the structure, cadence and instrumentation of the logging events in a suite of services
